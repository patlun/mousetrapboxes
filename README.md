openscad code for mouse trap boxes

When using mouse traps I have missed some mice because they have been able to access the trap from behind and even if the trap have triggered they have come away with the bait. I created a small box to prevent this and to force the mouse to access the bait in a optimal way for the trap.

The box also gives some protection from snow and ice if you place the trap outdoors

The box have two parts called bottom and top as shown below
